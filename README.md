# RNN-Transducer Speech Recognition

This repository contains code for training a Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T)
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model designed to run on Myrtle.aiâ€™s acceleration solutions for
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware.  The RNN-T model was chosen to enable streaming ASR.

Myrtle.ai's PyTorch-based RNN-T training environment, scripts and code are in [training](training).
